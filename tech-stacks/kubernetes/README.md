# Kubernetes

## Overview

[Why Kubernetes?](https://dev.to/aabhassao/kubernetes-bedtime-stories-393n)

- History:
  - Kubernetes wouldn't have been possible w/o Docker.
  - Google really wanted to keep the competition on with AWS S3.
- Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool.
- Each container (built using `docker` tool) can be deployed to different cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
- Kubernetes is a tool that helps in deploying and managing containers.
- **Analogy**: Just like post office helps in delivering letters to different addresses, Kubernetes helps in deploying containers to different cloud providers. No matter what, the container will be delivered to the address just like the letter will be delivered to the address mentioned on the envelope, managed well by post office. So, the objective is to keep the container (holding Apps, microservices) running and healthy.
